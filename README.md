## Temple of Thought

This name is referenced to the famous song by **Poets of the Fall**. I love everything about this song, and what better way to represent my **Obsidian vault** than by naming it like this! This is such a meaningful way to represent a note taking vault since this is a vault of my own thoughts and also human brain is such an amazing evolution of biology that it is worth preservation and worship. 

This Obsidian Vault consists mainly:
- I write my blogs here which I publish in my hashnode blog: [The Neural Notebook](https://theneuralnotebook.hashnode.dev/).
- My research journal where I read research papers and summarize my findings and understandings. 
- My Book journal which is similar to my research journal but I use it for my library full books (which reminds me that I need to finish them in my lifetime!)
- Some rough notes
- Some random thoughts, understanding or realisation.
- Some notes about some random learnings or obscure knowledge.

My main purpose of maintaining a vault of my thought (or a temple) is my life long goal of becoming a polymath of modern era. Let us see how much can I accomplish!

The folder structure and many ideas about Obsidian came from this beautiful and inspiring video by Odysseas: [Obsidian The King of Learning Tools (FULL GUIDE + SETUP](https://youtu.be/hSTy_BInQs8?si=hY4BA_WXVV8WpAgD). I actually came to know about Obsidian from this video. After that, I am just experimenting.
