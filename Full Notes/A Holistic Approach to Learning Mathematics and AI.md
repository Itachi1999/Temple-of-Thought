### A Holistic Approach to Learning Mathematics and AI

# Mathematics Relearning Pathway

## Overview
**Main Goal:** Holistically relearn mathematics with a strong emphasis on conceptual understanding, proof skills, and practical applications.  
**Timeline:** ~6 months (adjustable)  
**Tools:** Obsidian (for notes), Anki (for spaced repetition), Desmos/GeoGebra (for visualizations), Python (for projects)

---

## 1. Set Your Learning Environment

### Steps:
- **Learning Journal:** Use Obsidian to document concepts, proofs, and reflections.
- **Dedicated Time Slot:** 1 hour on weekdays (9 PM–10 PM), 2 hours on weekends (10 AM–12 PM).
- **Spaced Repetition:** Use Anki for memorizing key definitions, theorems, and proof techniques.
- **Track Progress:** Set weekly check-ins to review what you’ve learned and where you're facing challenges.

## 2. Build Core Intuition (Weeks 1–6)

### Focus:
- Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry
- Visual and intuitive understanding of fundamental concepts

### Books:
- **Algebra:** *“Algebra” by Israel Gelfand*
- **Geometry:** *“Euclid and Beyond” by Robin Hartshorne* or Khan Academy
- **Trigonometry:** *“Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell” by George F. Simmons*

### Resources:
- **Khan Academy** for interactive lessons
- **3Blue1Brown** for visualizing key concepts (Essence of Algebra, Trigonometry)

### Activities:
- **Daily Problem Solving:** Start solving problems from the books.
- **Weekly Summary:** Summarize key concepts learned. Use diagrams and write out explanations.
- **Visualize:** Use tools like Desmos/GeoGebra for graphing key concepts.

- **Mathematical Physics:** *“The Feynman Lectures on Physics”*

### Activities:
- **Explore Connections:** Start making connections between different mathematical fields and your interests (AI, music, art).
- **Wonder Day:** Pick a day each month to explore a new, unrelated mathematical concept and document it.
- **Creative Projects:** Integrate math into side projects (e.g., music theory and guitar).

---

## 7. Create & Synthesize

### Focus:
- Synthesize everything into a broader understanding of mathematics and its applications

### Activities:
